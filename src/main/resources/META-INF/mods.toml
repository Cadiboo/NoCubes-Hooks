description='''
A small(ish) Coremod for 1.12.2 to inject hooks into RenderChunk#rebuildChunk to allow Modders to add their own custom chunk rendering logic and other chunk rendering related modifications.
This mod provides configurable events that Modders can use for various chunk/world-related rendering logic
 - The RebuildChunkPreEvent is called before any chunk rebuilding is done and allows access to the IWorldReader
 - The RebuildChunkPreRenderEvent is called before any chunk rendering is done and allows access to the BlockRendererDispatcher and the usedRenderLayer boolean array
 - The RebuildChunkFluidRenderInLayerEvent allows Modders to modify the BlockRenderLayers that fluids can render in
 - The RebuildChunkFluidEvent is called for every BlockRenderLayer for every fluid and allows Modders to add their own logic
 - The RebuildChunkBlockRenderInTypeEvent allows Modders to modify the EnumBlockRenderType that blocks can render in
 - The RebuildChunkBlockRenderInLayerEvent allows Modders to modify the BlockRenderLayers that blocks can render in
 - The RebuildChunkBlockEvent is called for every BlockRenderLayer for every block and allows Modders to add their own logic
 - The RebuildChunkPostRenderEvent is called after all chunk rebuilding logic is done but before Tile Entities are updated
 - The RebuildChunkPostEvent is called right before the method returns
Note: OptiFine changes many things about rendering, so sub-events are fired when OptiFine is present. Sub events are the same as the their parents but allows access to OptiFine-related objects.
